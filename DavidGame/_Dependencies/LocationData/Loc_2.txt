Dungeon Enterance
###

You open the creaking door with extreme caution, peering your head around the door as you slowly move forward.

You walk into a large brick tunnel. Curious, you walk deeper into the tunnel, looking around for any hidden exits. 

You can't help but notice the smell of blood floating through the tunnel.

Suddenly a rat sprints past you with a deathly squeel and scurries away. You quickly look behind you. Nothing. 

You continue to walk down the tunnel and follow the rat. 

50 yards later you see it, perched upon what looks to be a trap door to the south side of the tunnel. 

The hinges are rusty but the stains on the wood suggest someone was here recently.

Ahead to your west you see what looks like a seperate tunnel, joined on to the main tunnel.
