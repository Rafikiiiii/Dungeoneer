Cave
###
You slowly open your eyes. You are standing at the enterance to a cave. Nothing is around you but trees. 
Out of desperation you enter the cave cautiously. You see a strange glowing light at what seems to be the end of the cave.
You walk towards the glowing light.

To your north there two large burning torches are hanging on the wall above a small splintered door in the wall. 
You look around the confined cave once more, this seems to be the only exit.
